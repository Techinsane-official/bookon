### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

#### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users and Authentication
users (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at)
user_profiles (id, user_id, first_name, last_name, phone, created_at, updated_at)
children (id, user_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, year_group, allergies, medical_info, emergency_contacts, created_at, updated_at)

-- Venues and Activities
venues (id, name, address, stripe_account_id, payout_schedule, created_at, updated_at)
activities (id, venue_id, title, description, start_date, end_date, start_time, end_time, capacity, price, status, created_at, updated_at)

-- Bookings and Payments
bookings (id, user_id, activity_id, child_id, status, total_amount, created_at, updated_at)
payments (id, booking_id, stripe_payment_intent_id, amount, fee_amount, status, created_at, updated_at)
refunds (id, payment_id, amount, reason, created_at, updated_at)

      - name: Run tests
      - name: Code coverage
      - name: Security scan
      - name: Build artifacts

  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
      - name: Run smoke tests

  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

## Next Steps

1. **Approve this plan** - Review and provide feedback
2. **Phase 1 Setup** - Initialize project structure and infrastructure
3. **Database Design** - Implement PostgreSQL schema
4. **Core Development** - Begin feature development
5. **Testing & Deployment** - Implement testing strategy and deployment pipeline

This plan ensures we build a production-ready, scalable, and secure platform that meets all MVP requirements while preparing for future growth and integrations.
